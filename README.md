This work develops an algorithm to use temporal ICA for robust estimation of a re-
gionally varying gas-switching response during oxygen-enhanced MRI (OE-MRI)
of the human lung. We apply the algorithm to a cohort of seven healthy- and ten long
COVID subjects imaged with the same OE-MRI sequence. The estimated oxygen
responses across manually segmented thoracic masks are used to fit piecewise ex-
ponential reference functions and statistically significant differences in the oxygen
wash-in/wash-out parameters are found between cohorts. Furthermore, an average
of > 90% of voxels are deemed oxygen-activated in either cohort, allowing spatially
continuous and distributed estimation of oxygen wash-in, wash-out, and ventilation
delay. By comparison, fitting models directly to the raw time series in each voxel in
the thoracic mask yields activation percentages ofâˆ¼60%. Further work is needed
to establish the clinical potential of the method and to render it computationally
viable beyond the research setting.
